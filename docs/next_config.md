The web content provides the content of the `next.config.mjs` file from the `short.dev` GitHub repository. Here's the extracted content:

javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}
export default nextConfig


**Explanation of the `next.config.mjs` file content:**

*   **`/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */`**: This is a JSDoc comment that specifies the type of the `nextConfig` variable. It indicates that `nextConfig` conforms to the `NextConfig` type, which is imported from the `next` module.
*   **`const nextConfig = { ... }`**: This defines the `nextConfig` object, which holds the configuration settings for the Next.js application.
*   **`eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true, },`**: This section configures ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` setting tells ESLint to ignore errors during the build process.
*   **`typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true, },`**: This section configures TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. The `ignoreBuildErrors: true` setting instructs TypeScript to ignore build errors.
*   **`images: { unoptimized: true, },`**: This section configures image optimization. The `unoptimized: true` setting disables Next.js's built-in image optimization features. This is useful if you are handling image optimization separately or if you want to serve the original images.
*   **`export default nextConfig`**: This line exports the `nextConfig` object, making the configuration available to the Next.js application.
